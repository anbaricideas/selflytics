Please reflect on the work conducted this session, and consider:
* were there any points of conflict or confusion that could have been avoided?
* did the development workflow go well and efficiently, for instance making best use of the available subagents?
* what improvements could be made:
  - Could my initial instructions have been better
  - Could Claude config/instruction files provide better guidance
  - Could the available subagents be better defined?
  - Would additional subagents have helped?
