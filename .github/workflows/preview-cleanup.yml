          ## Preview Cleanup Summary

          ✅ **Cleanup Completed**

          ### Details
          - **Feature**: \`${{ steps.feature.outputs.feature-name }}\`
          - **Service**: \`clinicraft-webapp-preview-${{ steps.feature.outputs.feature-name }}\`
          - **Trigger**: ${{ github.event_name }}

          ### Resources Removed
          - Cloud Run service
          - IAM policy bindings
          - Service logs (retained for 30 days in Cloud Logging)

          ### Verification
          Service no longer appears in Cloud Run service list.

          ### Next Steps
          If cleanup failed, you can manually trigger it again:
          \`\`\`bash
          gh workflow run preview-cleanup.yml -f feature_name=${{ steps.feature.outputs.feature-name }}
          \`\`\`

          Or clean up manually:
          \`\`\`bash
          gcloud run services delete clinicraft-webapp-preview-${{ steps.feature.outputs.feature-name }} \\
            --region=australia-southeast1 --project=${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          \`\`\`
          EOF
